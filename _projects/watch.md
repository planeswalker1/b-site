There where 2 main problems that I had when making this website.
They where:

* how to organize my javaScript
* how to use tilt.js


I organized my javaScript by keeping what is known as front-end and back-end logic separate. The code that handles interacting with a user is the front-end logic. The code that handles math is the back-end logic.

Tilt.js has great documentation. I did a small example using tilt.js and applied that example to this website.
